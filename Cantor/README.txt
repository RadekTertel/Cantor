HI!
This is my small project that I made for my course during second semester of studies.
The program converts certain amount of money in given currency to another currency, so it is basicaly currency converter.
All you have to do is select your source currency that you want to convert to other currency which you chose in the "final currency" box.
It is a simple program but extremely useful. Sometimes minimalism is good, enjoy !
